# Day 4 - Paper Rolls

## Abstract

We have a storage with paper rolls on a grid. They may be taken from storage, if they have less than 4 neighbours in the 8 spaces around them.

How many paper rolls can be taken ...
* Part 1: ... in the current situation?
* Part 2: ... if we keep on taking paper rolls from storage (and unblock paper rolls, that we initially can not take)?
