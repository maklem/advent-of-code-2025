# Day 6 - Math Homework

## Abstract

We are given plenty of calculations to perform. They can be sums `+` or products `*` I.e.

    123
     40
     5
    +

What is the total sum of all homework questions if numbers are interpeted ...
* Part 1: ... horizontally ( `123 + 40 + 5 = 168`)?
* Part 2: ... vertically ( `1 + 245 + 30 = 276` )?
