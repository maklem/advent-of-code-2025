# Day 9 - Rectangle Geometry

## Abstract

We are given a closed line of two dimensional coordinates.
What is the largest rectangle we can form with two of the earlier coordinates as corners, ...

* Part 1: at all
* Part 2: if all points of the area have to be on the inside of the initial geometric shape (including edges and corners).
