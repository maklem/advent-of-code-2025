# Day 10 - Linear Equations

## Abstract

In the factory we have machines with M buttons. There are N lights and powerlevels.
Every button is connected to 1..N lights/powerlevels.
* Part 1: Every button press toggles the connected lights. How many button presses are neccessary to get to a pattern defined for a machine?
* Part 2: Every button press increases the powerlevel on it's connected wired. How many button presses are neccessary to get to the powerlevel defined for a machine? (Button presses are non-negative natural numbers).

## Strategy

In part 2: Solve system of linear equations using [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination).
